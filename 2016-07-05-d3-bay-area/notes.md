## Meetup Description

📽 D3 Movie Night #2 🍿

@[h20.ai](http://h20.ai/)

Excited about a particular conference talk video, but don't want to watch it all by your lonesome? Just watched a conference talk, and have so much feels but no one to share them with?

Well have we got the event for you!

D3 Movie Nights: where we screen one or two conference talks and discuss our feels after, all while munching on some popcorn and sipping some soda. [We had a smashing good time last month](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-d3-User-Group/events/231225677/), so we're planning to make this a monthly event - join us 🎊!

Interested?

6:30PM: doors open 
7PM: [Eyeo 2015 – Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec](https://vimeo.com/133608605) 
8PM: discuss them feels

## Notes

### Video Notes

Dear Data – Before embarking on a year-long, time-, mind-, and paper-and-pencil-consuming collaborative data drawing project, Giorgia and Stefanie only met in person twice.

Those two meetings were at Eyeo 2013 and Eyeo 2014, so no wonder they had a very special conference in mind at which to first showcase it together!

Dear Data has always meant to be a personal challenge: they have been trying to extend themselves in both their data collection and their drawing technique: nudging themselves out of their comfort zone, and exploring and expanding on where one can find data and how it can be represented using new visual systems. 
Giorgia and Stefanie will share how compulsively-collecting and drawing mundane and messy personal data every week for a year (and posting it via snail mail to each other) has offered a chance for investigations and insights into their profession, their personal selves, and each other’s lives.

### Post Video Discussion Notes

I would love to make a library like d3.sketchy called d3.watercolors, using the color and texture of watercolors

> An unusual choice for a d3 movie, but an excellent one. Dear Data strips viz design to the essentials, with some oddly beautiful and informative results.
