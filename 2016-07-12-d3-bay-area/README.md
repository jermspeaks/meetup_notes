> To kick things off this month our food and drink sponsor, 
> [Datazar](https://www.datazar.com/) will be talking about how they integrated D3js into their platform. 
> The platform uses D3 as the primary visualization engine 
> and allows members of the platform to create their visualization 
> as light modules and allows them or other members to call those modules 
> from Datazar’s analysis language, ‘dz’. 
> With the recent of D3js v 4.0, he will be walking through the new possibilities 
> and also talk about the challenges of using D3js in a way that accommodates 
> a wide array of functionalities and datasets. 
> Making complex D3js visualizations will follow the talk.


> who will cover the primary sources of complexity in data preparation 
> and some useful principles for dodging them.
> Getting good data for your visualization can sometimes be half the battle, 
> but it doesn't have to be. 
> He believes with the right knowledge and tools, 
> much of the pains we face when prepping our data 
> for the perfect visualization can be avoided.
