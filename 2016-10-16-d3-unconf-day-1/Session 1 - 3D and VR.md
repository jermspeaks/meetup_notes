3D and VR
A lot of current progress is happening in gaming and entertainment. We can learn from what they are doing to apply to data vis. Some immediately relevant explorations are in the HUDs for showing in-game data.
UX considerations
Movement in VR can cause motion sickness, some techniques in games explore alternatives to continuous walking. For example teleporting to a point that you target: TODO ADD EXAMPLE LINK 

Spatial reasoning

Spatial memory

Because we have depth and motion, we have more behaviors to work with. We can see what people are doing so there is more to study about what works.
Data Visualization Experiments

Scientific visualization
Object manipulation (like proteins)


Web Technology
THREE.js
A-Frame VR
ReactVR

Can think of adding 3D as another level of progressive enhancement

handling larger files/assets

MVP project
A 3d immersive environment for playing with a list of blocks.
can pick a block and place it in the 3d environment. think minecraft on a table

Geometry for a block-block
a brick with each side that has same ratio of 960x500
try to get preview image on each side of the block-block
