Boardroom
Generative art
Christophe Viau: videos at https://vimeo.com/christopheviau

Superformula: extension of superellipse. Some patterns like those in nature.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula

Do you decide what you want to create upfront, or let it emerge?
Depends on the project - artist’s intention is what turns it into art

#d3brokeandmadeart (intention is to make an exhibit of prints from this)
On d3 slack and on Twitter
Also: http://glitch-chart.tumblr.com 

Kristin Henry: started with particles for chemistry students
Generating textiles (funded Indiegogo project)
Project with Stamen to visualize sounds in the Mission District

Eric Socolofsky: try Processing (Java or JS) or OpenFrameworks (C++)
Processing: p5.js is the latest
OpenProcessing: https://www.openprocessing.org/browse
Cinder: https://libcinder.org/
openFrameworks: http://openframeworks.cc/

Anyone doing it in d3?
Kristin Henry: http://kristinhenry.dunked.com/
Migrating to v4, mostly not online yet

Why not use d3?
Think in pixels, often want to get out of the browser for more processing power
Most existing work is in the creative coding community, who use Processing and OpenFrameworks

Generative art is about rules and parameters

  What else do we need in d3 to help make generative art?
  The browser is a big limitation
  Try Electron

  We want to use d3 because we want to bind with data
  Generating art from data - not from a set of rules - which is where d3 becomes the key tool
  Visualizing algorithms
  Combining canvas with SVG elements
  Interaction is another benefit d3 brings to data art (binding is useful here)
  Better tools for data processing would help, but this is not d3-specific
  Use d3 for quick sketches before porting to something else - avoid complex d3-specific stuff though
  Fitbit demo: prompt to breathe more in line with the motion, real time feedback


Create a basic block to help others get started? And fork from there?
