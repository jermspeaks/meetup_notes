@redblobgames showed off some small projects
http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html - how the A* tutorial is put together with layers; apply a css 3d transform on each layer to show them separated out (implemented as one extra function that reuses the existing diagram code, but applies the css to it)
http://www.redblobgames.com/x/1638-voronoi-strategy-mapgen/ - procedural map generator using d3.voronoi, simplex noise, and stylized rendering to make it look hand drawn
http://www.redblobgames.com/x/1530-facegen/ - cartoon face generator
http://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen3/demo.html - incomplete d3.voronoi rewrite of http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/ (flash project, back in 2010)
http://www.redblobgames.com/x/1505-beta-distribution/ - using an idea from games other than “gamification” to encourage the reader to explore a parameter space; also, marking various outcomes in colors
http://www.redblobgames.com/x/1640-hexagon-tiling-of-sphere/ - game space where player sees a planar map, but it’s a sphere topology underneath (the problem is that a hexagonal tiling of a sphere always contains 12 pentagons, which makes everything harder to deal with)

Three people showed games written in d3; don’t know the links

Shirley had an amazing visualization that I can’t even describe
