## Patient Files

Paper files -> Digital files (in a server)

Databases - for scaling servers to add patient data

Load Balancer - for basic web architecture

## Problems

1. Physical Risk
1. Data Sharing
1. Security Risk

Physical = environmental / external issues

HIPA act - not allowed to share data
- Must be encrypted in storage and transit

Hospital hackers - Ransomed your data

## Flatiron
