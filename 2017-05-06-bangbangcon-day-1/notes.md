## Notes

### Keynote: Cyborgs Unite! (Karen Sandler)

- Open source vs closed source software for medical devices
- Cyborg - Having an implant like a pacemaker
- She's part of the Software Freedom Conservancy, as we learned on Changelog interview
https://changelog.com/podcast/238
- Talk keeps getting morbid :)
- She has a big heart, and her pacemaker needs to be replied
- Trying to find a pacemaker without remote control over RFID
- Medical doctor, representative, customer support, engineer -- what software is it written in?
- CyborgA

### jq functional language (Charles Chamberlain)

- Not just a way of querying through json
- Functional language without needing to deal with the types
