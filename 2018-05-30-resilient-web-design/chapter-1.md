# Resilient Web Design
## Chapter 1 Foundations

### Notes

> These echoes of the past reverberate in the present even when their usefulness has been outlived. You’ll still sometimes see a user interface that displays an icon of a Compact Disc or vinyl record to represent music. That same interface might use the image of a 3½ inch floppy disk to represent the concept of saving data. The reason why floppy disks wound up being 3½ inches in size is because the disk was designed to fit into a shirt pocket. The icons in our software interfaces are whispering stories to us from the history of clothing and fashion.

World Wide Web as a rounding error to those in cosmotology. Tim Berners-Lee developed it at CERN while his supervisor awarded Tim time, remarking, "vague, but interesting." 

CERN was already within the Internet system, and the World Wide Web would be built on top of the existing system.

> The open architecture of the internet reflected the liberal worldview of its creators. As well as being decentralised, the internet was also deliberately designed to be a dumb network. That’s its secret sauce. The protocols underlying the transmission of data on the internet—TCP/IP—describe how packets of data should be moved around, but those protocols care not a whit for the contents of the packets. That allows the internet to be the transport mechanism for all sorts of applications: email, Telnet, FTP, and eventually the World Wide Web.

> Tim Berners‐Lee did not invent hypertext. That term was coined by Ted Nelson, a visionary computer scientist who was working on his own hypertext system called Xanadu. Both Ted Nelson and Tim Berners‐Lee were influenced by the ideas set out by Vannevar Bush in his seminal 1945 essay, As We May Think. Bush, no doubt, was in turn influenced by the ideas of Belgian informatician Paul Otlet. Each one of these giants in the history of hypertext was standing on the shoulders of the giants that had come before them. Giants all the way down.

Tim assumed linking would go to other files, like documents. But to his surprise, people used HTML to build full websites.

Scientists at CERN had been sharing documents called SGML. Tim took those **existing vocabulary as a starting point rather than to creating something from scratch**.

> Tim Berners‐Lee was using when he created HTTP, HTML, and the world’s first web browser, called confusingly WorldWideWeb, which only worked on NeXT machines.

Nicola Pellow wrote another browser called the Line Mode Browser, which could work on any OS. The World Wide Web was now accessible to anyone.

Interoperability and backwards compatibility became important issues. Some of the initial spec for HTML didn't work on the Line Mode Browser. 

Under the heading "Next ID", Tim Burners-Lee wrote:
> Browser software may ignore this tag.

For browsers that did not understand some of these tags, this decision would have far-reaching consequences for the future of the World Wide Web.
