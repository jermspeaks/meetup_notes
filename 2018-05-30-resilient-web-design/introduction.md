# Resilient Web Design
## Introduction

Chronicles the history of web design to explore ideas and approaches. 

> You won’t find any code in here to help you build better websites. But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are more resilient than code. I’ve tried to combine the most resilient ideas from the history of web design into an approach for building the websites of the future.

Quote from Marshall McLuhan:
> We look at the present through a rear‐view mirror. We march backwards into the future.
