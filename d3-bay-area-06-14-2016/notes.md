## Presentation Notes

Ran into Rolf today, mentioned CastAR might be hiring. Follow up.

- HR data science === ppl analytics 
- Cognitive funnel: 
	- a funnel chart going both ways with a "frozen middle". looks like an hourglass
	- at the top of the funnel, we see "Data"
	- at the bottom of the funnel, we see "Shareholder Value"
	- Data viz can help melt the "frozen middle"
	- "Frozen Middle" is the disconnect between the data and the shareholders
- Check out Keller's talk @ Open Vis Conf 2016 on pre-attentive processing
  - He goes over the neuroscience of cognitive load
- Nadia Bremer

Show & Tell

- Embedded Canvas in SVG
- turf.js with Mapbox for showing parks and feathering each polygon to see radius of each park to where you live in SF
- kurd algorithm: merge overlapping rectangles/polygons recursively
  - Less computation intensive for the browser to compute feathering radius on 200+ polygons 

I want to do a show & tell with that police data I got from Buzzfeed
- Find a client
- Work on potential sketches
